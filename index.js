                        <p>India has immense talent, but it often lacks direction. Many students, especially from Tier-2 and Tier-3 colleges, have the ambition but not the roadmap to reach their dream careers in tech. Traillixz was created to bridge this gap. Our mission is to provide clear, actionable, and completely free career roadmaps that guide students from the classroom to their first high-paying tech job or enterprenuers.</p>

                        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-3">Our Story</h2>
                        <p>Founded by Chellu Naga Praveen, Traillixz was born from a simple observation: while premium resources exist, they are often locked behind expensive paywalls, leaving out a huge pool of deserving talent. We believe that financial constraints should never be a barrier to knowledge. That's why we've curated the best free resources on the internetâfrom YouTube tutorials to official documentationâand structured them into logical, step-by-step learning paths. We present not creating the content; we create the map that leads you through it.</p>

                        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-3">What We Do</h2>
                        <p>We provide meticulously crafted roadmaps for various tech careers, including Full-Stack Development, Data Science, and UI/UX Design. Each roadmap is broken down into phases and weeks, with clear goals, key learnings, recommended free resources, and a "Proof of Work" project to solidify your skills and build your portfolio. It's not just about learning; it's about doing.</p>
